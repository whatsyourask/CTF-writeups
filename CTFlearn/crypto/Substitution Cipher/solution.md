I can use online tool for that, but we need to know what it is.

In cryptography, a substitution cipher is a method of encrypting by which units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext, according to a fixed system; the "units" may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. The receiver deciphers the text by performing the inverse substitution. Substitution of single letters separately — simple substitution — can be demonstrated by writing out the alphabet in some order to represent the substitution. It is a cipher key, and it is also called a substitution alphabet.
