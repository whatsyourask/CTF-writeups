Just overflow it with `A * 100` to see the picture:

![begin](screenshots/begin.png)

Next i overflow it with `A * 50`:

![A*50](screenshots/A*50.png)

Now time to look at the source code:

![source](screenshots/source.png)

As we can see i input the 50 bytes when the source code tell us that padding with A must be 48 bytes.
