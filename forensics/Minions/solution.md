I downloaded a file and tried different ways. First of all, i forgot about `binwalk`
and tried `strings` or `exiftool`. `Strings` worked, but on next file it didn't.
Then i tried another way with `binwalk` and it works well.

![first](screenshots/first.png)

![cat ..txt](screenshots/cat_..txt.png)

Download this file. Then just again `binwalk`.

![second](screenshots/second.png)

![strings](screenshots/strings.png)

![decode](screenshots/decode.png)

To get a flag you need to decode it a few times yet.
